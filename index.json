[{"content":"There are lots of definitions of the circular economy out there. The way I see it, traditionally, if you bought something and didn\u0026rsquo;t want it anymore, it was your responsibility to figure out what to do with it. As landfills piled up with trash, polluting the environment and threatening to spillover, you started hearing noises about recycling. Then we came to the wonderful alliterative paradigm - reduce, reuse, and recycle. I\u0026rsquo;m all for encouraging individuals to play their part in saving the planet. But let\u0026rsquo;s face it, as individuals, we have other priorities. And there\u0026rsquo;s only so much an individual can do on their own. Ultimately, we need to make systemic changes to make a meaningful difference to the looming climate crisis.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where circular economies have a role to play. If we make corporations responsible for the trash generated from their products, they have an incentive to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. There are several strategies that corporations can employ to this end:\n First of all, design products that don\u0026rsquo;t end up in landfills. Making products that are made with recyclable materials, and are easy to repair allows people to use them for longer and keeps stuff out of landfills. Secondly, building a service infrastructure that allows for easier access to refurbishing and repairing services is equally important. Finally, closing the supply chain by collecting old and unwanted product for recycling and/or reclaiming material will ensure we get the most use out of scarce resources.
